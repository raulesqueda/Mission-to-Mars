# Mission-to-Mars


For this challenge we help to Robin to make a web app, but she wants to add more information. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. So, she would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
